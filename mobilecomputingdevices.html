	<td>PDAs are handheld devices which combine computing, telephone / fax, 
	Internet and networking elements into a single device. A typical PDA can 
	serve as a mobile phone, fax sender, Web browser and personal organizer.</td>
	<td>The smartphones combine a single device with a mobile phone and a handheld
	computer. Smartphones enable users to access and store information ( e.g. e-mail)
	and install programs (applications) while also enabling one device to use a mobile 
	phone. A smartphone, for example, could be a mobile phone with some PDA functions
	built into the device or vice versa.</td>
	<td>Tablet PCs are the evolution of a touchscreen LCD screen notebook computer that 
	can be used with your fingertips or stylus. The handwriting with a stylus is digitized 
	and can be converted by handwriting recognition to standard text, or it may remain as handwritten text.</td>
