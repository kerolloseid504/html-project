    <h2>Basic Concepts of Mobile Computing<h2>
      <p>Mobile Computing is A technology that is capable of
         providing an environment which enables users to transmit
          data from one device to other device without the use of
          any physical link/cables. It means that data is transmitted
           wirelessly using wireless devices such as mobile devices, laptops, etc.
         <br>Mobile computing is an interaction between computers and humans.
          Mobile devices may be linked to a neighborhood called the Local Area
           Network (LAN), or they may use Wi-Fi or remote innovation through
           remote neighborhood (WLAN) interfacing. Mobile generally refers to
           moving access and is thus unlimited to a given geographical area</p>

		   <h2> Mobile Computing Future</h2>
		   <p style="color:black; font:20px; margin-left:60px; font-weight:bold;">Although mobile computing technology started very slowly but 
		   is now becoming cheaper due to mobile devices and its availability
		   its growth is enormous. Still relatively new in the field of medical 
		   applications, commercial products are being developed by several companies 
		   to solve a wide range of problems. Implanted wireless devices will monitor
		   our health continuously in the future, enabling the medical profession to 
		   treat the majority of diseases in its infancy. Mobile computing will also
		   be used to monitor our diet and its health effects, to control unhealthy 
		   habits such as smoking and alcohol use, and to maximize the effects of exercise. 
		   Diseases such as diabetes will be virtually controlled through wireless monitoring
		   and corrective action devices, which will adjust the insulin levels automatically
		   without even knowing the patient.With technology shifting from 2 G to 3 G and to 4 G, 
		   it's possible that nearly all of the devices we use from cars, different devices in our 
		   homes will use this in some way or another. Many other concepts have evolved, such as cloud computing , 
		   grid computing which adds to this area.</p>
