	<ol>
	<li>Programing Languages</li>
	<p>Programming languages are used for the software for the mobile system.
	Operating system functions to run components of the software onto the hardware.
	Deployment of middleware components. Uses layered structure arrangement of components
	for mobile computing. Protocols and layers are used for conveying and receiving.
	<br> The programing languages are used for mobile computing:
	<br>C and C++, Visual C++, Visual Basi,  Java - J2SE, J2ME (Java2 Micro edition),  JavaCard (Java for smart card)
 </p>
 <li>Operating System</li>
 <p>The operating systems used in Mobile Computing applications are Symbian OS,
 Window CE, Mac OS. It offers the user to run an application without having to 
 consider the specifications and functionalities of the hardware. It provides
 functions which are used in a system to schedule the multiple tasks.
 <br>It provides the functions required for the synchronization of multiple
 tasks in the system. It uses multiple threads synchronization and priority 
 allocation. Management functions (such as creation, activation, deletion, 
 suspension, and delay) are used for tasks and memory. It provides Interfaces
 for communication between software components at the application layer, 
 middleware layers, and hardware devices. It facilitates the execution of
 software components on diversified hardware. It provides Configurable 
 libraries for the GUI (graphic user interface) in the device</p>
 <li>Middleware</li>
 <p>Software components which link the components of the application
 to the components distributed by the network. The nearby device such as 
 Bluetooth is discovered with it. To achieve device synchronization with 
 the server or an enterprise server, it is used to discover the nearby hot spot.
 It is used for the retrieval of data from a network database (which may be in Oracle or DB2).
 It is used at network for service discovery. It is used to adapt the application to the 
 platform and availability of the services</p>

	<h1>Architecture of Mobile Computing Applications</h1>
	<ol style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">
	<li style="font-size:30px;">Clients</li>
	<p>There are many types of mobile devices, including RIM devices, 
	cellular phones , PDAs, tablets , computers, and laptop computers. 
	These mobile devices can normally be used as thin clients or as 
	fat clients, or they can be developed to host web pages</p>
	<li style="font-size:30px;">Thin Clients</li>
	<p>Thin clients do not have custom application code, and rely
	entirely on the server for its functionality. They do not rely 
	as heavily on the operating system of the mobile device as fat 
	clients, or the type of mobile device. Typically, thin clients 
	use widely available web and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 
	browsers to display content pages for the applications.</p>
	<li style="font-size:30px;">Fat Clients</li>
	<p>Typically, fat clients have one to three layers of 
	application code on them, and can operate independently
	of a server for some time. Fat clients are typically most
	useful in situations where communication between a client 
	and a server is not guaranteed.
	<br>For example, a fat client application may be able to 
	accept user input and store data in a local database until 
	connectivity with the server is re-established and the data 
	can be moved to the server.</p>
